\*Instructions

Dynamic web application game where users are presented with 10 character cards. The object of the game is to select each card without selecting the same card twice. The game is 90's cartoon character themed. If a user selects the same card twice, the user is prompted with an alert and the score is reset, displaying the user's last high score.

\*Technologies

This game was built with the following technologies:
React
Flexbox
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap

\*Challenges

Originally I had used fixed margins and padding to create the layout of the cards. With the fixed margins/padding, the application was displaying differently on different screens and screen sizes. I spent time learning more about flexbox after the creation of this application and returned to update it. I removed the fixed margins/padding and implemented flexbox which helped the responsiveness of the website.
